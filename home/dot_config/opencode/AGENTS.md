# Global agent rules

These rules apply to every OpenCode session, across every project.

---

## Always active

These constraints are unconditional. Apply them without being asked.

- **No em dashes.** Use commas, colons, or restructure the sentence. Never generate `—`, `---`, or `&mdash;`.
- **Never guess schemas or APIs.** Read the authoritative source first (Go structs, official docs, or the project's own examples). Blog posts and AI-generated examples are not acceptable. If docs don't render, clone the repo and read the struct tags directly.
- **Clone repos to read source.** Never curl GitHub API endpoints or fetch raw URLs. `git clone` first, then read.
- **All Python through mise.** Never invoke `python`, `pip`, `uv`, or `uvx` directly. Load the `python-toolchain` skill before any Python work.
- **Never accept a limitation without investigating.** Keep working until the problem is actually solved. Suggesting workarounds as a final answer is not acceptable.
- **Don't say "Docker containers."** Docker is a brand name, not a container type. Write "containers" or "OCI images" in prose. Action references like `docker/login-action` are fine as-is.

## Skills and subagents

Load skills on-demand via the `skill` tool. Use subagents for delegated async work.

| Name               | Type     | When to use                                                            |
| ------------------ | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `memory`           | skill    | Before writing to any AGENTS.md file                                   |
| `dotfiles`         | skill    | Before any change to chezmoi-managed files                             |
| `python-toolchain` | skill    | Before any Python, pip, uv, or mise work                               |
| `retrospective`    | skill    | After completing any non-trivial task                                  |
| `@daily-note`      | subagent | Logging achievements to today's Obsidian daily note (ask user first)   |

When delegating to subagents at session close, run them in sequence: one at a time, wait for each to complete.

---

## Session close: mandatory

After every non-trivial task, load the `retrospective` skill and follow it before closing out.

Ask the user before logging to the daily note. Never log proactively.

---

## Memory

Global memory is `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md` (source: `~/.local/share/chezmoi/home/dot_config/opencode/AGENTS.md`).
Local memory is the `AGENTS.md` in the current project root (or nearest ancestor).

Never edit `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md` directly; it is chezmoi-managed. Load the `memory` skill for all writes.

For rules specific to the chezmoi dotfiles repo itself, the target is `~/.local/share/chezmoi/AGENTS.md`.

When updating any memory file: review nearby rules for contradictions, duplication, and scope conflicts; reconcile in the same edit. Keep cross-cutting rules in global memory; keep project-specific rules in local memory.

---

## Git and commits

- Before committing, run `git diff --staged` and confirm the change is atomic and in-scope. Do not commit unrelated modifications.
- Commit message format: `type(scope): description`. Types: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`. Check `git log --oneline` to match repo style.

---

## Shell discipline

- Prefer the smallest atomic command that completes the immediate next step. Do not chain concerns across policy boundaries.
- Keep source edits, `chezmoi apply`, and git operations as separate commands unless a later step strictly depends on the previous one within the same concern.
- Destructive or policy-sensitive actions should be isolated so intent is easy to inspect.
- Do not check whether a directory exists before using it. Attempt the operation; create the directory if it fails.

---

## Custom commands and subtask isolation

- Treat custom commands with `subtask: true` as isolated subagent executions with no access to the current session context.
- Session-aware commands (retrospectives, reviews) should run in the current session, not as subtasks.

---

## Toolchain

- When a CLI can be managed by `mise`, run it through `mise x -- <command>`. Do not invoke managed tools directly.
- When `chezmoi apply` triggers a brew bundle run (via an onchange script), treat it as fire-and-forget once the apply succeeds.
