## About

[link.sh] allows you to easily link and manage your git-controlled dotfiles on
any machine you happen to be working on, permanently or temporarily. Note: this
script was written to work with older versions of Bash, specifically those
without support for associative arrays (versions < 4).

## Setup

By default link.sh will read its configuration settings from
`~/etc/.link.conf`. To change this, pass the `-u` flag followed by the
location of the configuration file. Add the following to your shell's rc to
make this permanent:

1. if link.sh in `$PATH`:

    ```
    alias link.sh='link.sh -u ~/path/to/.link.conf'
    ```

2. if link.sh not in `$PATH`:

    ```
    alias link.sh='~/path/to/link.sh/link.sh -u ~/.path/to/link.conf'
    ```

Specify the git repository containing the dotfiles by setting the `SOURCE_DIR`
variable in the configuration file.

The configuration file contains an array of the files to be managed. It should
be set up such that index 2k is the source file in the repository, and index
2k+1 is the destination of the link.

Example:

    # ~/etc/.link.conf

    SOURCE_DIR=$HOME/etc
    BACKUP_DIR=$SOURCE_DIR.bak

    FILES=(
        bashrc          $HOME/.bashrc
        gitconfig       $HOME/.gitconfig
        inputrc         $HOME/.inputrc
        profile         $HOME/.profile
        ssh/config      $HOME/.ssh/config
        vim             $HOME/.vim
        vimrc           $HOME/.vimrc
        zshrc           $HOME/.zshrc
    )

## Usage

Run the script without any arguments to see the current status of the files
being managed:

    link.sh

If the script shows existing files, back them up with:

    link.sh -b

This will backup the existing dotfiles into `BACKUP_DIR`. Useful when working
on a machine temporarily.

To write the symlinks for files that don't exist, use the `-w` flag,
otherwise, overwrite them by adding the `-f` flag:

    link.sh -w
    link.sh -wf

To restore the environment to its original state, use:

    link.sh -r

Use the `-h` flag to see an overview of all available options:

    link.sh -h
